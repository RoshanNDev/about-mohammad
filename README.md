I grew up in **Pakistan** but at the age of 9 I moved to NYC. Starting school in NYC was pretty hard for me as I barely knew English at the time. I like to play videogames and basketball in my freetime. I also love to watch comedy movies.
My favorite movie is _Scarface_ I have watched it atleast 7 times.
